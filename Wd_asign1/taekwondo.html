        <h1>My Taekwondo Journey and Achievement</h1>
        <p id="my_tkd">At the young age of 8, I began my journey with Taekwondo at the Taekwondo Lam Ha Club, and since then, I have remained a dedicated member for over a decade.

            <h3>Friends</h3>
            <p>Taekwondo has brought me so much more than just physical fitness; it has also given me lifelong friendships. Throughout my life, I have found that my closest friends are those who share my passion for Taekwondo. These are the friends who have been with me since childhood, and have shared in both the joys and sorrows of life.

For me, the true value of Taekwondo lies not just in the techniques and skills, but in the bonds of friendship that it has fostered</p>
